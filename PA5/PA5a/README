The next homework will use sed and will have two parts.
The first part, PA5a.sed must use only sed commands we learned in lecture 8.
It prints the 5 cards in the hand and detects if they are either a Flush or
Four of a kind.

The second part of the homework will use ideas from lecture 9, so you won't
get that part of the assignment until after we attend class for lecture 9.

The assignment will be turned in together, but you can start on the first
part now, since it is only allowed to use lecture 8 material.

You will notice three other files included with this README file:

    % ls
    PA5atemplate.sed  README  UNIXPA5a.png  allcards
    %

allcards is the same file as in the earlier homeworks.

PA5atemplate.sed is a template on how to do the first part of the assignment.

UNIXPA5a.png is a screeshot of how your program should work. You will notice
that it uses some sed syntax from Lecture 9 to get specific sets of 5 cards.
This isn't a real issue, however, because of three reasons. 1) It's code I'm
giving you, so you can type it even if you haven't learned Lecture 9. 2) We
will get to Lecture 9 quite soon, and then it will make sense. 3) The real
way that the game would really be played is shown on the last line of the
screenshot: "sort -R allcards | head -5 | sort -g" -- which doesn't require
the use of any sed.
